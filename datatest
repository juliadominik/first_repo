Although TLR9 is known to play an important role in inflammation and innate immunity, its role in mediating adipose tissue inflammation has not yet been investigated. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the role of TLR9 in regulating immune cells in visceral adipose tissue and maintaining the metabolic homeostasis. Wild-type and TLR9-deficient mice were fed with a high-fat diet, and the body weight gain, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and adipose tissue inflammation were examined. TLR9-deficient mice gained significantly more weight and body fat under a high-fat diet than wild-type mice and exhibited more severe glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. We also found a dramatic increase of M1 macrophages as well as TH 1 cells in the adipose tissue of TLR9-deficient mice compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, the levels of various proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were higher in TLR9-deficient mice.","output":"TLR9 signaling is involved in regulating adipose tissue inflammation and controlling obesity and the metabolic syndrome.\n\n###Answer: yes"},"truncated_cells":[]},{"row_idx":22,"row":{"instruction":"Being a doctor, your task is to answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.\nAnalyze the question given its context.

Combination therapy was followed by 96 weeks of ADV monotherapy. Here, we report on the final outcome after 144 weeks of sequential antiviral treatment. Twenty-four patients were analysed, triplet liver biopsies (taken at baseline, week 48 and week 144) were available from 16 patients. At week 144, 12/15 patients positive for hepatitis B virus e antigen (HBeAg) had lost HBeAg, alanine transaminase (ALT) levels were normal in 23 patients (96%), median serum HBV DNA had decreased by -4.9 log10 copies/ml and was undetectable (<100 copies/ml) in 11/24 individuals (46%). Median total intrahepatic HBV DNA had decreased by -2.2 log. Although no further significant cccDNA changes occurred between week 48 and week 144, two years of ADV monotherapy proved capable of controlling cccDNA levels in most patients. Analysis of intrahepatic HBV DNA species demonstrated that combination therapy with PEG-IFN-alpha2b and ADV inhibited viral productivity by 99% and subsequent ADV monotherapy by 76%, respectively. Virus suppression to undetectability within the first 12 weeks of treatment was strongly associated with long-term virological response and HBeAg and hepatitis B virus surface antigen HBsAg seroconversion. Histological improvement was determined in 11/16 patients at week 144. Two patients developed ADV resistance during the third year of treatment.","output":"Reduction of intrahepatic viral load achieved after 48 weeks of combination therapy with PEG-IFN-alpha2b and ADV was maintained in the following 96 weeks of ADV monotherapy and translated into long-term clinical benefit for most of the treated patients.\n\n###Answer: yes"},"truncated_cells":[]},{"row_idx":23,"row":{"instruction":"If you have expertise in healthcare, assist users by addressing their medical questions and concerns.","input":"Hello Dr.I have query regarding bacterial infection.In my family, one member is affected by bacterial infections in leg.(with swallon below infected area)We have shown it to Dermatologist here 3 days back.

This study was designed to assess the influence of microscopic ETE on disease recurrence. Retrospective analysis of 212 patients undergoing thyroidectomy for PTC between 1995 and 2004 with minimum 3-year follow-up was conducted. Of 212 patients, 71 had ETE; 32% were macroscopic and 68% microscopic. Patient demographics, tumor variables, and adjuvant therapy were similar between both ETE groups. Recurrence rates were 52% for macroscopic ETE, 21% for microscopic ETE, and 13% without ETE. On multivariate analysis, patients with macroscopic ETE had a 6.4-fold increased relative risk of recurrence compared with patients with microscopic ETE (P < .02; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-25.9) and a significantly decreased disease-free survival (DFS).

It is, however, not known whether and to what extent this genetic susceptibility may be attenuated by a physically active lifestyle. We aimed to assess the influence of a physically active lifestyle on the genetic predisposition to obesity in a large population-based study. We genotyped 12 SNPs in obesity-susceptibility loci in a population-based sample of 20,430 individuals (aged 39-79 y) from the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort with an average follow-up period of 3.6 y. A genetic predisposition score was calculated for each individual by adding the body mass index (BMI)-increasing alleles across the 12 SNPs. Physical activity was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. Linear and logistic regression models were used to examine main effects of the genetic predisposition score and its interaction with physical activity on BMI/obesity risk and BMI change over time, assuming an additive effect for each additional BMI-increasing allele carried. Each additional BMI-increasing allele was associated with 0.154 (standard error [SE] 0.012) kg/m(2) (p = 6.73 x 10(-37)) increase in BMI (equivalent to 445 g in body weight for a person 1.70 m tall). This association was significantly (p(interaction) = 0.005) more pronounced in inactive people (0.205 [SE 0.024] kg/m(2) [p = 3.62 x 10(-18); 592 g in weight]) than in active people (0.131 [SE 0.014] kg/m(2) [p = 7.97 x 10(-21); 379 g in weight]). Similarly, each additional BMI-increasing allele increased the risk of obesity 1.116-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.093-1.139, p = 3.37 x 10(-26)) in the whole population, but significantly (p(interaction) = 0.015) more in inactive individuals (odds ratio [OR] = 1.158 [95% CI 1.118-1.199; p = 1.93 x 10(-16)]) than in active individuals (OR = 1.095 (95% CI 1.068-1.123; p = 1.15 x 10(-12)]). Consistent with the cross-sectional observations, physical activity modified the association between the genetic predisposition score and change in BMI during follow-up (p(interaction) = 0.028).","output":"Our study shows that living a physically active lifestyle is associated with a 40% reduction in the genetic predisposition to common obesity, as estimated by the number of risk alleles carried for any of the 12 recently GWAS-identified loci.

Increased sympathetic activity may play a role in the development of atrial fibrillation, and reduced beta-receptor activity may be advantageous. The objective was to evaluate the effect of oral beta-blockade on the frequency of atrial fibrillation and to evaluate some possible causative factors. The study was prospective, randomized, and double-blind, and was conducted at Aarhus University Hospital. Thirty patients without previous or present cardiovascular history undergoing elective thoracotomy for lung resection. The patients received either 100 mg of metoprolol or placebo orally before surgery and once daily postoperatively. Anesthesia consisted of a thoracic epidural block combined with general intravenous anesthesia. Epidural morphine was continued postoperatively. Patients were monitored with electrocardiograms (ECGs), capillary pulse oximetry, invasive hemodynamic monitoring, central venous oxygen saturation, arterial blood gases, serum electrolytes, and fluid balances. Atrial fibrillation developed in 23.3% of the patients, 6.7% after metoprolol compared with 40% in the placebo group. Atrial fibrillation developed a mean of 2.9 days postoperatively. The predominant hemodynamic findings were perioperative lower oxygen consumption and postoperative lower cardiac index after metoprolol.

It's a cytotoxic drug that interferes with DNA replication, which is effective in treating various types of cancers, but it sometimes results in a toxic syndrome known as hemorrhagic cystitis. \n\nHemorrhagic cystitis is characterized by symptoms such as blood in the urine (hematuria), urinary frequency, urgency, and lower abdominal pain. The inner lining of the bladder becomes inflamed and starts to bleed, resulting in these symptoms. It's worth noting that not all patients on cyclophosphamide-induced therapy will develop this condition, but it's a well-recognized side effect of the drug.\n\nMethotrexate, Rituximab, and Prednisone don't commonly cause these symptoms, making cyclophosphamide the most probable cause in this scenario.\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT."},"truncated_cells":[]},{"row_idx":63,"row":{"instruction":"In the clinical text, your goal is to determine connections between medical problems, treatments, and tests.

In my opinion the chance of pregnancy in your case is very rare. Because it was protected intercourse with condom and emergency pill was also taken. Emergency pill is 95% effective if taken within 72 hours of intercourse. The emergency pill causes hormonal imbalance and effects the timing and bleeding of the period. So the period can be either delayed or come early and bleeding can either be heavy or irregular or scanty. So relax the delay in period could be due to pill. I suggest you to do a urine pregnancy test a week after missed period. If the test is negative the delay can be due to pill. And wait for spontaneous onset of periods. But overall the chances of your pregnancy are very, very rare or nil. Avoid stress. Nothing to worry as such. Hope this helps.

LCA is leukocyte common antigen and is a marker for disease type in NHL. World Health Organization broadly classifies lymphomas into Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

A panel of markers is decided based on morphological differential diagnosis (no single marker is specific) which includes leukocyte common antigen (LCA), B-cell markers (CD20 and CD79a), T-cell markers (CD3 and CD5).LCA is used to classify the NHL to be of a particular type and to guide the treatment to be given. Knee replacement or bone grafting depends on the area of involvement. Knee replacement and arthrosis are two different procedures. If there is sufficient uninvolved bone surface to allow knee replacement then it can be done."},"truncated_cells":[]},{"row_idx":95,"row":{"instruction":"In your capacity as a doctor, it is expected that you answer the medical questions relying on the patient's description.\nAnalyze the question given its context.

However, such trauma scoring systems reflect the patient's physiological condition, which can only be determined to a limited extent, and are difficult to use when performing a rapid initial assessment. We studied the predictive ability of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) score compared to other scoring systems. We retrospectively reviewed 229 patients with multiple trauma combined with chest injury from January 2006 to June 2011. A SIRS score was calculated for patients based on their presentation to the emergency room. The patients were divided into two groups: those with an SIRS score of two points or above and those with an SIRS score of one or zero. Then, the outcomes between the two groups were compared. Furthermore, the ability of the SIRS score and other injury severity scoring systems to predict mortality was compared. Hospital death occurred in 12 patients (5.2%). There were no significant differences in the general characteristics of patients, but the trauma severity scores were significantly different between the two groups. The SIRS scores, number of complications, and mortality rate were significantly higher in those with a SIRS score of two or above (p<0.001). In the multivariant analysis, the SIRS score was the only independent factor related to mortality.","output":"The SIRS score is easily calculated on admission and may accurately predict mortality in patients with multiple traumas.\n\n###Answer: yes"},"truncated_cells":[]},{"row_idx":96,"row":{"instruction":"Your role as a medical expert involves identifying the associations between genes and diseases in the clinical text.

When I urinate in the morning it a little yellow. Pls want do I do now What is wrong with me.","output":"Thanks for posting your query to Chat Doctor. As I understand you are suffering form some kind of preaxial illness. There are so many causes for such kind of illness. I suggest you to undergo some investigation to confirm the diagnosis and then start treatment . It may not be only malaria, but some other infection could be there. So I advised you to undergo :1. Complete blood count.2. Widal test.3. Malaria antigen test 4.SGPT and Stall this test will help in deciding further treatment plan.

Small periapical lesions of endodontic origin usually heal by conventional endodontic therapy alone. Larger periapical lesions presumed to be cystic may require additional treatment protocols to aid in regression. Conservative nonsurgical management of such lesions eliminates the possible complications of surgery and has wider patient compliance and acceptance. A periapical cystic lesion associated with maxillary central incisor and lateral incisor was treated conservatively using buccal aspiration decompression followed by conventional endodontic therapy employing calcium hydroxide iodoform paste as intracanal medicament is reported.","output":"The treatment was successful as evidenced by relief of symptoms and radiographic evaluation.\n\n###Answer: yes"},"truncated_cells":[]}],"num_rows_total":205048,"num_rows_per_page":100,"partial":false}
